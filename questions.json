            "options": ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
            "correct_answer": "4",
            "solution": "1. Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8\n2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4",
            "explanation": "This is a basic linear equation. We isolate x by first subtracting 5 from both sides to get 2x = 8, then dividing both sides by 2 to get x = 4."

            "solution": "1. sin(90°) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse\n2. At 90°, the opposite side equals the hypotenuse\n3. Therefore, sin(90°) = 1",
            "explanation": "At a 90° angle, sin(90°) equals 1 because the opposite side and hypotenuse have the same length in this case."
